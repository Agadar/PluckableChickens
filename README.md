## Description

Pluckable Chickens is a mod for Minecraft that makes chickens pluckable, allowing you to farm them for feathers. Simply use a shear on a chicken, just like how you would shear a sheep, and watch the feathers drop from the chicken! The chicken's feathers will regenerate over time, just like a sheep's wool, allowing you to shear them again in the future. Chickens whose feathers haven't regenerated yet won't drop feathers when killed, though they can still fly despite the absence of feathers.

This mod works by intercepting normal chickens from spawning, and substituting them with this mod's own pluckable chicken mob. As such, this mod might not work nicely together with other mods that interact or alter normal chickens.
